 # Spyder

F5 executes the current file

F9 executes the currently highlighted chunk of code: this is very useful to update definitions of functions (say) in the console session without having to run the whole file again. If nothing is selected F9 executes the current line.

Tab auto-completes commands, function names, variable names, methods in the Console (both Python and IPython) and in the Editor. This feature is very useful, and should be used routinely. Do try it now if auto-completion is new to you. Assume you have defined a variable:

mylongvariablename = 42
Suppose we need to write code that computes mylongvariablename + 100, we can simply type my and then press the Tab key. The full variable name will be completed and inserted at the cursor position if the name is unique, and then we can carry on and type + 100. If the name is not uniquely identifiable given the letters my, a list field will be displayed from which the right variable can be chosen. Choosing from the list can be done with the <Arrow up> key and <Arrow down> key and the Enter key to select, or by typing more letters of the name in question (the selection will update automatically) and confirming by pressing Enter when the right name is identified.

Ctrl+Enter executes the current cell (menu entry Run > Run cell). A cell is defined as the code between two lines which start with the agreed tag #%%.

Shift+Enter executes the current cell and advances the cursor to the next cell (menu entry Run > Run cell and advance).

Cells are useful to execute a large file/code segment in smaller units. (It is a little bit like a cell in an IPython notebook, in that chunks of code can be run independently.)

Alt+<Up Arrow> moves the current line up. If multiple lines are highlighted, they are moved up together. Alt+<Down arrow> works correspondingly moving line(s) down.

Ctrl+Left Mouse Click on a function/method in the source, opens a new editor windows showing the definition of that function.

Shift+Ctrl+Alt+M maximizes the current window (or changes the size back to normal if pressed in a maximized window)

Ctrl+Shift+F activates the search pane across all files.

Cmd + + (On MacOS X) or Ctrl + + (otherwise) will increase the font size in the Editor, whereas Cmd + - (Ctrl + -) will decrease it. Also works in the IPython Console.

The font size for the Help, the Python console etc. can be set individually via Preferences > Help etc.

I couldn't find a way of changing the font size in the variable explorer.

Cmd+S (on MacOS X) and Ctrl+S (otherwise) in the Editor pane saves the file currently being edited. This also forces various warning triangles in the left column of the Editor to be updated (otherwise they update every 2 to 3 seconds by default).

Cmd+S (on MacOS X) and Ctrl+S (otherwise) in the IPython console pane saves the current IPython session as an HTML file, including any figures that may be displayed inline. This is useful as a quick way of recording what has been done in a session.

(It is not possible to load this saved record back into the session - if you need functionality like this, look for the IPython Notebook.)

Cmd+I (on Mac OS X) and Ctrl+I (otherwise) when pressed while the cursor is on an object, opens documentation for that object in the help pane.

## Unix Brief

What is unix?: (basic)

* Unix is one of the "multi-tasking", "multi-user", "multi-thread" computer operating system.
* was developed by Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson (FKn Genius) starting on 1970s and belongs to the AT&T company
* was a little bit under-powered though

What gives UNIX the popularity?
* 1972, unix was re-written in C landuage (by ken Tompson in majority)
    * C was a lower programming landuage
    * at the time, the sybolic landuage was more polupar (but requires you to rewrite the whole system for adj)
* By the computer scientist, for the computer scientiest
* A&T (1975) was banned to sell computer system (so they are forced to give out the system for free), and that is also when the edu/ gov get in touch the system for a main-frame computer
* A good new operating system for the mainframe computer (using one core computer + many keyboard and monitor)

> Open source(Linux), close source(orcle), mixed source(Apple's Mac os)\
(Max OS = BSD Unix + NexTSTEP + Apple Codeing)

Characteristics:

* Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the "Unix philosophy". 
    * Quote: "A programmer can write a few line of code, that trun into many many instructions in the machine. That way, when the changes needs to be make, we'll just change a few lines of code, rather than thousands and thousands of them."
* The unix is made of three lays:
    * Center layer: The `KENAL` is what controlls the resources of the machine, usually the kernal is standrized on every machine
    * Medium layer: The `SHELL` is the interface between the kernal and the most users
    * Outter layder: The `UTILITIES` (user programs) 
        * e.g adding compiler for the landuage, document formatting landuages/ programs... or programs that u write yourself
* What differs unix with other operating system is the concept of `MODULE`
    * The unix has a very important comcept of module
    * unlike most of the OS, modules in unix can be glued together in variety of ways to get the job done
    * variety of combining the modules and changing the flow of the data
* not very unique, but unix has the idea of hierarchy
* since the flow of the input is controlled by the shell, the input/ouput of a specific program (Outter layer) can be redirected unlike other operating system

Why using the UNIX instead of the graphical interface (GUI)?
* there a lot more power in command line 
    * e.g finding a file including "invoice"
        * UNIx will only have the text file name so small data group
        * GUI might include the time/ content of the file which slows the program down

> What other operating system, example of the comparison????? \
> Command prompt vs a shell (unix interface connecting the kernal and the user program) ??\
> What is open source??? why is it important for user
> unix dirived systems ???? what are the braches extends from unix\

## what is floating point

* 0.000000015 in scientific notation is 1.5 * 10^-8
    * '1.5' is expressing the `mangnitude` of this floating point number, called `Mantissa`
    * '10^-8' is showing the point is floaing down for 8 places, called `Exponent`, the number we use to float for a negative direction. 
> BIT <=> **BI**nary digi**T**\
> BYTE <=> **B**inar**Y** **TE**am

* Now in binary: 
* (e.g an 8-bit binary memory)
    1. 4 bits mantissa
    2. 4 bits exponent
* 0110 0010
    1. 0010: Exponent 
        * |2^(-8)|2^4|2^2|2^1|
            |-|-|-|-|
            |0|0|1|0| 
        * Exponent: 10^(0010) => 2^(2)
        * `For why (-8) see the signed binary code below`
    1. 0110: Mantissa
        * |-1|1/2|1/4|1/8|
          |-|-|-|-|
          |0|1|1|0|
        * Mantissa before floating: 0.110 => 3/4 (2^(2))
        * Mantissa after  floating: 011.0 => 3

> Denary Number <=> Decimal, base-10

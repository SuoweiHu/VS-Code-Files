 Set 
* A set is a collection of elemtns 
* Not in any order (not needed to be)
* each element only appear `once`
---
Finite Set
* Singleton: only one element {x}
* Booleam: False and True {True,False}
* Range of numbers: {1,2,3,....,19}
---
Infinite Set
* Natural Number
* Intergers 
* Real numbers
* `Strings`: List of character of any finite length
> Why is string a infinite set????
---
Combining set
* Sum: A + B, the two set remain disjoint
    * e.g A = True,False B = True,False
    * A + B = {(True, form A), (True, fomr B)......}
* Product: A x B, the two set is forming a `new set`
---
Functions 
* f:: A -> B, A called domain, B called codomain
    * The function assign `every` input A in domain on to `some` of the B in codomain as ouput
    * f :: A -> B, can also be written as f(a)=b
---
Minus :: Z -> Z is defined as minus(x) = -x
isPod :: Z -> B is defined as isPod(x) = T (if pos); F (is neg)
* Here x and y are called variables, and are in set Z
---
Polymorphic Functions 
* A function that can be defined `simultaneously` for many different sets is called polymorphic.
    * identity funciton: 
        * id :: A -> A def as id(a) = a
    * constant zero function: 
        * constZero :: B-> Z def as constZero = 0
> What about containning more than one set, such as two set (not containning all the set known), such as the previous minus function, applies for Z and R, but not for B, is it polymorphic
---
Other example of the polymorphic functions:
* Left/ Right Injection:
    * injR :: A -> A + B def as injR(a) = (b,a) 
    * injL :: A -> A + B def as injL(a) = (a,b)
    * injection means appening/adding the element 
* Left/ Right Projection:
    * proR :: A + B -> A def as proR(a,b) = (a) 
    * proL :: A + B -> A def as proL(a,b) = (b) 
---
Combining functions: Composition
* g * f(a) = g(f(a))
---
Combining sets: Set of functions 
* by given domain and codomain as A and B
* A->B menas the set of `all possible functions from A to B`
* f::A -> B means f is one of the element of set A -> B (all the possible function of going from set A to set B)
> what does it mean by f::A->B then \
> Does it mean that the ooooo question solved by PPT XD
---
Combining sets - sets of functions
* Right associativity: 
    * `A -> B -> C = A -> (B -> C)`
    > then does the above set means: all the functions of going from set A to (function of going from set B to set C)?????
* E.g: given:
    * f :: A -> B -> C
    * a,b,c are elements of A,B,C individually
    * f(a) is the function of (B -> C)
    * so there is A -> (B -> C) is def by a=f(a)
    * f(a) x b is an element of set C
---
Combining sets - set of functions
* Polymorphic example:
    * *pair :: A -> B -> A x B* is def by *(pair(a))(b) = (a,b)*
    * *cmopose :: (B -> C) -> (A -> B) -> A -> C* is def by *(compose(g))(f)(a) = g(f(a))*
        * That is g :: B-> C, and f :: A -> B, and a :: A
    > How to explain `pair` and `compose` with the Right Assiciativity properties when combining set ????? A -> (B -> AxB) ???????
    >
    > Quiz: can you define a sensible polymorphic function from the set
    >A + B ⟶ (A ⟶ B) ⟶ (A ⟶ C) ⟶ C?

`Disjunctive normal form`
* For output equals to 1 express with AND, and join the result with OR, the result is said to be disjunctive normal form
* e.g Design a circuit (X,Y,Z) = (1,1,1) & (1,0,0)  
---
`Predicate`
* sentence containning one or more than one var, with the property that when a value is given to the var, it became a statment
* e.g 
    * P(x) = x is a cat; (Who is peter) 
    * Q(X) = X has the full controll of the system; (Is x the admin, or just generic user)
* demain will vary depending on the set of value that var can take
* Two ways to turn a predicate into a statment:
    1. specify the value of variable (x)
    2. quantify the value of the variable (x)
        * Quantify = express quantity
        * Universal Quantifier:  A upside down (For all) ------> universal statment
        * Existential Quantifier: E mirror image (For some) -----> exismential statment
        * e.g 
            * Domain: {1,3.0000,2,"hello",'r',1999999}
            * p(x) = "x is a integer" 
            * For some x ........ will be a existential statment 
---
`∃!p(x)` means there exist only one (unique) x such that the statment p(x) is true

* 2.1 Difference (A\B or A-B = "A without B")
* 2.2 Difference (B\A or B-A = "B without B")

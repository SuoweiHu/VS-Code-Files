F5 executes the current file

F9 executes the currently highlighted chunk of code: this is very useful to update definitions of functions (say) in the console session without having to run the whole file again. If nothing is selected F9 executes the current line.

Tab auto-completes commands, function names, variable names, methods in the Console (both Python and IPython) and in the Editor. This feature is very useful, and should be used routinely. Do try it now if auto-completion is new to you. Assume you have defined a variable:

mylongvariablename = 42
Suppose we need to write code that computes mylongvariablename + 100, we can simply type my and then press the Tab key. The full variable name will be completed and inserted at the cursor position if the name is unique, and then we can carry on and type + 100. If the name is not uniquely identifiable given the letters my, a list field will be displayed from which the right variable can be chosen. Choosing from the list can be done with the <Arrow up> key and <Arrow down> key and the Enter key to select, or by typing more letters of the name in question (the selection will update automatically) and confirming by pressing Enter when the right name is identified.

Ctrl+Enter executes the current cell (menu entry Run > Run cell). A cell is defined as the code between two lines which start with the agreed tag #%%.

Shift+Enter executes the current cell and advances the cursor to the next cell (menu entry Run > Run cell and advance).

Cells are useful to execute a large file/code segment in smaller units. (It is a little bit like a cell in an IPython notebook, in that chunks of code can be run independently.)

Alt+<Up Arrow> moves the current line up. If multiple lines are highlighted, they are moved up together. Alt+<Down arrow> works correspondingly moving line(s) down.

Ctrl+Left Mouse Click on a function/method in the source, opens a new editor windows showing the definition of that function.

Shift+Ctrl+Alt+M maximizes the current window (or changes the size back to normal if pressed in a maximized window)

Ctrl+Shift+F activates the search pane across all files.

Cmd + + (On MacOS X) or Ctrl + + (otherwise) will increase the font size in the Editor, whereas Cmd + - (Ctrl + -) will decrease it. Also works in the IPython Console.

The font size for the Help, the Python console etc. can be set individually via Preferences > Help etc.

I couldn't find a way of changing the font size in the variable explorer.

Cmd+S (on MacOS X) and Ctrl+S (otherwise) in the Editor pane saves the file currently being edited. This also forces various warning triangles in the left column of the Editor to be updated (otherwise they update every 2 to 3 seconds by default).

Cmd+S (on MacOS X) and Ctrl+S (otherwise) in the IPython console pane saves the current IPython session as an HTML file, including any figures that may be displayed inline. This is useful as a quick way of recording what has been done in a session.

(It is not possible to load this saved record back into the session - if you need functionality like this, look for the IPython Notebook.)

Cmd+I (on Mac OS X) and Ctrl+I (otherwise) when pressed while the cursor is on an object, opens documentation for that object in the help pane.

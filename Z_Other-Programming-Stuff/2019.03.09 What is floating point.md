## what is floating point

* 0.000000015 in scientific notation is 1.5 * 10^-8
    * '1.5' is expressing the `mangnitude` of this floating point number, called `Mantissa`
    * '10^-8' is showing the point is floaing down for 8 places, called `Exponent`, the number we use to float for a negative direction. 
> BIT <=> **BI**nary digi**T**\
> BYTE <=> **B**inar**Y** **TE**am

* Now in binary: 
* (e.g an 8-bit binary memory)
    1. 4 bits mantissa
    2. 4 bits exponent
* 0110 0010
    1. 0010: Exponent 
        * | 2^(-8) | 2^4  | 2^2  | 2^1  |
            | ------ | ---- | ---- | ---- |
            | 0      | 0    | 1    | 0    |
        * Exponent: 10^(0010) => 2^(2)
        * `For why (-8) see the signed binary code below`
    2. 0110: Mantissa
        * | -1   | 1/2  | 1/4  | 1/8  |
          | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
          | 0    | 1    | 1    | 0    |
        * Mantissa before floating: 0.110 => 3/4 (2^(2))
        * Mantissa after  floating: 011.0 => 3

> Denary Number <=> Decimal, base-10

Interpreter vs Compiler
* Compiler 
    * `translate` the source landuage (higher-level landuage) into object landuage (machine language)  
    * `faster` (sine machine landuage) / but `more` memory
    * generate inter-mediate program during compile
    * `HARD` to debug (display all the error at onece, might relate to cross reference etc)
    *  ~~compiler is a program that reads a program written in the high-level language and converts it into the machine or low-level language and reports the errors present in the program. It converts the entire source code in one go or could take multiple passes to do so, but at last, the user gets the compiled code which is ready to execute.~~
    
    > Phase Of compiler ??????????
    >
    > ~~Compiler operates in various phases each phase transforms the source program from one representation to another. Every phase takes inputs from its previous stage and feeds its output to the next phase of the compiler. There are 6 phases in a compiler~~

* Interpreter 
    * `stimulate` the source landuage (Such as custom lib)
    * take the whol praogram and translate
    * take a line of code 
    * `slower` / but `less` memory
    * not produce inter-medium code
    * `EASY` to debug (display error on each line)
    * ~~Employing an interpreter is advantageous during program development, where the most important part is to be able to test a program modification rapidly rather than run the program efficiently.~~

* COMPILER LANDUAGE:
    * C
    * C#
    * C++
    * Scala

* INTERPRETER LANDUAGE: 
    * PHP
    * Peral
    * Ruby

Programming paradigms: 

* Control flow: imperative/declarative
* Declarative: functional/logic/finite state machines
* Allocations and bindings: static/dynamic
* Time: event-driven/discrete/synchronous/continuous
* Focus: control flow/data flow
* Concurrency: sequential/concurrent/distributed
* Structure: modular/generics/templates/objects/aspects/agents
* Determinism: deterministic/non-deterministic
* You donâ€™t need to understand all of these; just many ways to program

> Further research on this topic please 

> What is the imperative/declarative ?????? imperative = programmer telling the computer the state/ number etc ?????? declartive = tell computer what to do with the data 

> Is it the Imperative tells program HOW TO DO ????\
> And Declarative tells the program WHAT SHOULD BE THE OUTPUT ????

> Calling the function is declarative?????

Phase Of Compilation:
1. Lexical analysis
    * checking wether there is lexies that is not part of the current compiling environment (word block that computer can take as an input) 
2. Syntax analysis
    * Checking wether the operation is permitted by the current programmign landuage 
    * Such as missing parathesis

3. Semantic analysis
    * Checking weather there are type errors 
    * e.g1
        * void fucntion_name(int,string); 
        * then if you try to use void (char,float)
        * a semantic error will pop up
    * e.g2
        * int x = 20/3 (giving float)

4. Intermediate code generator
    * the operation can be divided into parts
    * e.g 
        * total = count + rate * 5 (Source Code)
        * 
        * t1 := int_to_float(5) 
        * t2 := rate * t1 
        * t3 := count + t2
        * total := t3           (Intermediate Code)


5. Code optimizer
    * removing the un-necessary code: annotations, loop that the program will not go into, un-necessary type changing, etc
    * e.g
        * intofloat(2.00) => 2.00
        * void function_name () {if(FALSE){}} => NULL
        * #123 => NULL

6. Code generator
    * a = b + 60.0 => Code below 
    * 
    * MOVF a, R1
    * MULF #60.0, R2
    * ADDF R1, R2

OUTLINE:\
Lexical analyzer: Wrongly spelled tokens\
Syntax analyzer: Missing parenthesis\
Intermediate code generator: Mismatched operands for an operator\
Code Optimizer: When the statement is not reachable\
Code Generator: Unreachable statements\
Symbol tables: Error of multiple declared identifiers

Python Error Sum: [List of python error message](https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/people/mccann/errors-python)

* index_error:
    * when you created a list of x size, and uses the (x+n) element of the list (out of range) 
* ModuleNotFoundError: 
* ImportError:
* StopIteration:
* typeError: 
    * the type of the program does not follow the semantic grammar
* ValueError:
    * when the function has invalid/ inappropriate argument
* NameError:
    * when the object cannnot be found (such as forgetting the pre-def)
* ZeroDivisionError
* KeyboardInterrupt
    * usually happen when a user enters CTRL + C to terminating the program
* AttributionError
    * see type error, *[attribution error example](http://cs.carleton.edu/cs_comps/1213/pylearn/final_results/encyclopedia/attributeError.html)*
* indentationError
    * missing/ exceeded a tab/ space

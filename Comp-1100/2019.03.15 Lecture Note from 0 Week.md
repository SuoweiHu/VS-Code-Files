# week 1 Haskell syntax:

## Comments

* * single line `--the_comment_you_wanna_put`
    * multi line comment `{-The_comment_here-}`

## Conditionals

* * ``` haskell
      if (expression_condition_1)
      	then action_1
      else
      	if(expression_condition_2)
      		then action_2
      	else
      		if(expression_condition_3)
      			then action_3
      		else
      			else_actiion
      {-Using if then-}
      ```

    * ```haskell
        case (expression) of
        	Condition_1 -> action_1
        	Condition_2 -> action_2
        	Condition_3 -> action_3
        	_ -> else_action
        {-Using cases-}
        ```

    * ```haskell
        expression
        	|Condition_1 = action_1 
        	|Condition_2 = aciton_2
        	|Condition_3 = aciton_3
        	|otherwise = action_otherwise
        {-Using guards-}
        ```

    * The three code above are using different versions to separate flows, that is using IF THEN , CASES, and GUARDS. They vary sometimes in python

    ### Function pattern matching

    * ```haskell
        f [ ] = 0
         f [x] = 1
         f _ = -1
        ```

    ### Function conditionals (guards)

    * ```haskell
         f x | x == []        = 1
             | length x == 12 = 15
             | otherwise      = -1
        ```

## Saving work

* where 

* ```
  f x = I * I
  	where I = x * g
  ```

* let in 

* ```
  f x = let I = x * g
  	in I * I
  ```

## Declaring types

* data 

* ```
   data List = Cons Int List
             | Nil
             deriving (Eq, Show, Ord)
  ```

  TODO: What does deriving here means ??????

  TODO: What does the above programs does????? |Nil is going to do what ?

* type 

* ```
   type String = [Char]
   type Name = TypeValue
   type FUCK_YOU = Maybe I_DO_WANNA_SAY_THAT
  ```

* class

* ```TO
   class Check a where
       test :: a -> Bool
       force :: a -> a
  ```

  TODO: Try to understand the previous code 

* Instance 

* ```
   instance Show List where
       show x = "No show"
  ```

  TODO: Try to understand the previous code

## Calling functions

* named functions 

* ```
   myFunc :: Int -> Int -> Int
   result = myFunc 1 2
   result = 1 `myFunc` 2
   result = (myFunc 1) 2
   result = (`myFunc` 2) 1
  ```

* Named operators

* ```
  (+) :: Int -> Int -> Int
   result = 1 + 2
   result = (+) 1 2
   result = (1 +) 2
   result = (+ 2) 1
  ```

## List Expressions

* Using ...

   ```
   [1..] = [1,2,3,4,5,6...
   [1..5] = [1,2,3,4,5]
   [1,3..5] = [1,3,5]
   ```

* List comprehension 

   ```
      [ x*x | x <- [1..3] ] ==> [1,4,9]
      [ (x, y) | x < - [1..3], y <- "ab"] ==> 
         [(1,'a'),(1,'b'),(2,'a'),(2,'b'),(3,'a'),(3,'b')]
      [ (x,y) | x <- [1..4], even x, y <- "ab" ] ==>
         [(2,'a'),(2,'b'),(4,'a'),(4,'b')]
      map f xs ==> [ f x | x <- xs ]
      filter p xs ==> [ x | x <- xs, p x ]
   ```

TODO: Try understand the code above



## Snippet

 * ```
   fst3 :: (a, b, c) -> a
   snd3 :: (a, b, c) -> b
   thd3 :: (a, b, c) -> c
   
   --here we can have
   fst3 (x,_,_) = x
   snd3 (_,x,_) = x
   thd3 (_,_,x) = x
   ```

* To ignore you can use underscore

## Ordering 

```
ordPair :: Ord a => a -> a -> (a, a)
ordPair x y = if x < y then (x, y) else (y, x)
```

## Splitting 

```
   split :: [a] -> ([a], [a])
   split []  = ([], [])
   split [a] = ([a], [])
   split (a:b:xs) = (a:as, b:bs)
      where (as,bs) = split xs
```

## Command line syntax

 * Auto check 

 * ```
   -- | Adding one.
   --
   -- >>> addOne 5
   -- 6
   --
   -- >>> addOne 100
   -- 101
   
   addOne :: Int -> Int
   addOne x = x + 50
   ```

 * here is the console is not outputting 6 for `addOne` 5 the console will give an error

# Week 2 Combining Sets

## What is A->B

A -> B is a set of all the possible function to map A to B

## Right Associativity 

We can extend the ⟶ symbol to more than two sets via right
associativity:
• e.g. 𝐴𝐴 ⟶ 𝐵𝐵 ⟶ C is 𝐴𝐴 ⟶ (𝐵𝐵 ⟶ C), the set of functions from 𝐴𝐴 to
𝐵𝐵 ⟶ C.
• Different from (𝐴𝐴 ⟶ 𝐵𝐵) ⟶ C

## combining sets

* pair :: A -> B -> A x B is defined as (pair(a))(b) = (a,b)

* compose ∷ (B ⟶ C) ⟶ (A ⟶ B) ⟶ A⟶ C is defined as
   (compose 𝑔) (𝑓)(𝑎) = g(f(a))
   We usually write comp𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑔𝑔 𝑓𝑓 as 𝑔𝑔 · 𝑓𝑓, of course.

   TODO: What dooooossssee compse mean ????????????? and do of course

# Week 2 Sytax Tree (Module)

```haskell
module Variable = struct
type t = string
end
module Expression = struct
type t =
| Const of int
| Var of Variable.t
| Neg of t
| Sum of t * t
| Product of t * t
end
let some_math = Sum ((Const 5), (Var "foo"))
```
TODO: Later to be updated by finish reading [Jane_Stree](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1100/lectures/Jane_Street.pdf)

# Week 3 Case Expression

## Case Expression

```haskell
data Bool = True | False
myNot :: Bool -> Bool
myNot b =
   case b of
   True -> False
   False -> True 
```
Here we have 
```haskell
fUnction_name :: Type_name -> Other_type_name 
fUnction_name Input_var_of_type_name =
   case Input_var_of_type_name of 
   -- case the input floows the cases below:
      case_1 -> case_1_output
      case_2 -> case_2_output
      case_3 -> case_3_output
```


Below is an example of the CASE using prelude defined data 
```haskell
data Bool = True | False
myAnd :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
myAnd b c =
   case (b,c) of
      (True,True) -> True
      (True,False) -> False
      (False,True) -> False
      (False,False) -> False
```

Below is an other example of CASE using user defined data
```haskell
data Animal = Cat | Dog | Cow | Parrot String|Fox
says :: Animal -> String
says x =
   case x of
      Cat -> "meeow"
      Dog -> "woof"
      Cow -> "moo"
      Parrot name -> "pretty " ++ name
      Fox -> error ("what does the fox say)
```
==(->error("ErrorString"))== is the General Debugging of the Haskell
The previous program will print `below` if you pop in `says Fox`
```
"*** Exception: What does the fox say??
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
   error, called at Test.hs:21:14 in main:Test
```

## Guarded expression (guards)

* Bennifits comparing to case expression:
   * when you want to subject your data to lots of
   different tests with boolean results
   *  they can make programs easier to
   write and read
   * Case can only be used wehn threr is Boolean

Unessiary Sytax such as guards which make a programmer's life easier, by reading the lines easier are called ==Sytax Suger==

The below two code do the same thing

```haskell
myAbs :: Int -> Int

myAbs x =
   case x >= 0 of
   True -> x
   False -> -x

myAbs x
   | x >= 0 = x
   | otherwise = -x
```

```haskell
approxSize :: Int -> String

approxSize x
   | abs(x) > 1000000000000000000 = "quintillions"
   | abs(x) > 1000000000000000 = "quadrillions"
   | abs(x) > 1000000000000 = "trillions"
   | abs(x) > 1000000000 = "billions"
   | abs(x) > 1000000 = "millions"
   | abs(x) > 1000 = "thousands"
   | otherwise = "small"

VS

approxSize x =
   case abs(x)> 1000000000000000000 of 
      True  -> "quintillions"
      False -> case abs(x) > 1000000000000 of 
         True -> "quadrillions"
         False -> 
            ....
            ....
               ....
               ....
                  True -> "thousands"
                  False -> "small"

```

==Guard Expression will evaluate in order until the top most guard that evaluate is true== 

That is the Case expreesion will go from TOP to BOTTOM, if any statment is to its preference, the function will stop and return the value. 

However, the guard expression will go from the BOTTOM to TOP, until meets a TOP most statment that is false.

## Piecewise definition (Another Suger)


Compare the code below 
```haskell
myNot :: Bool -> Bool

myNot b =
   case b of
      True -> False
      False -> True

VS

myNot::Bool->Bool

myNot False = True
myNot True = False
```

we can see that picewise def is very benificial for data of small amount of members, however, for data with a large amount of members such as int or float, we will have the condition `below`, in which we will have to manually input every possible input 
```haskell
pieceWisePlusOne :: Int -> Int

pieceWisePlusOne 1 = 2
pieceWisePlusOne 2 = 3
pieceWisePlusOne 3 = 4
pieceWisePlusOne 4 = 5
pieceWisePlusOne 5 = 6
pieceWisePlusOne 6 = 7
....
....
piceWisePlusOne (upBound-1) = upBound
```

But we can still do ==picewise + general== definition, but do keep in mind the sequence of the definition matters !, as the prior defined will be runed first !

```haskell
pieceWisePlusOne :: Int -> Int

pieceWisePlusOne 1 = 2
pieceWisePlusOne x = x + 1
```

# Week 3 - Thu: Lists and Recursion

## Recursive types
* A recursive type is one whose definition makes mention of the type itself.
* Such as `data SwearingWord = Fuck | SmDick | SwearingWord`

## *Lists 
### Exmaple 
* Imagine a line of people 
* [] [] [] [] P P P P P P
* where [] is empty space P is People 

```haskell
data [Person] = [] | Person : [Person]
```

in default, HasKell will takje it as the `list` people is made of `[]| people:[people]`, that is:
   "A list of person" is either "empty" or "A person Follored by more persion"
      
The previous line of code can be simplified to
```haskell
data [A] = [] | A : [A]
```
Therefore, even a person can be a list, because A : [A] can be A :[]

==\":"== is a constructor with two arguments (written infix), pronounced ==cons==

Hence 

* A [Person] of length one can be written e.g.
• Alice : []
• [Alice]

* A [Person] of length three can be written e.g.
• Alice : (Bob : (Charlie : []))
• Alice : Bob : Charlie : [] 
• [Alice, Bob, Charlie]

### List of other types 

   data [Int] = [] | Int : [Int]
   data [Char] = [] | Char : [Char]
   data [Int -> Bool] = [] | (Int -> Bool) : [Int -> Bool]

### Droste effect

The Droste effect is a Dutch term for a specific type of recursive picture. An image exhibiting the Droste effect depicts a smaller version of the image within itself in a recursive manner.

### Recursion Properties (informally form these pictures)
   * Each instance size 
      * maybe the same 
      * may change 
   * Termination of the recursion
      * the chain of instances of the problem may go forever (unbounded recursion)
      * the chain of instances of the problem may terminate (bounded recursion)

TODO: [Recursion in Programming](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/23recursion/)
TODO: [Haskell Tree](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.6.0.1/docs/Data-Tree.html)

   * Why are recursion important:
      * Recursive programs can perform actions (perhaps slightly different each
time) repeatedly, and that is like the core of computer programming 
      * Program verification is easier (prove induction) (1,2,3 k, k+1)  

#### To solve a question by recurion:
   
* ==Base case== 

   You need to first identify the smallest piece of data, called Base Case,and write code to sove that problem *without using recursion*. 
   
   Small question such as when (x = 1), to solve for 12=x+1.

* ==Step case==
   then  See how solutions at a certain sacle, can sovle question in a bigger version 
   • Involves one or more ==recursive calls==, where we just ==trust== that the right
answer will be given!

##### ==Fundemental of recursion==:
   * There is a base case
   * Each recursive call must at the end leading toward the base case  

Mutural Recursion
```haskell
isEven :: Integer -> Bool
isEven n
   | n == 0 = True
   | otherwise = isOdd (n - 1)
   isOdd :: Integer -> Bool
isOdd n
   | n == 0 = False
   | otherwise = isEven (n - 1)
```

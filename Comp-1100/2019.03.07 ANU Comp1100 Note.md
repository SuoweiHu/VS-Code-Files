# Prelude

The [prelude](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#g:1) is a standard module. (It is alike a function that is imported by default). The prelude is imported by default into all haskell modules unless either there is an explicit import statment for it, or the Non-prelude extension is enabled. 

The prelude is included in the [basic library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base).

A prelude includes:
* Standard types
* Standard classes 
* The Related functions

# Binary  Overflow 

1. Sufficient Memory and proper carry bit (show sign) (1 menas minus, 0 means pos)
    * 17(DEC) = 10001(BIN) 
    * 19(DEC) = 10011(BIN)
    * 
    * Therefore
        *  010001
        * +010011
        * =100010 (BIN) = 36(DEC)
        * 17 + 19 = 36
    * The binary system can give

1. `In-Sufficient Memory` and no carry bit (show sign)
    *  31(DEC) = 11111
    *   1(DEC) = 00001
    * 
    * Therefore
        *  11111
        * +00001
        * =00000 (BIN) = 0(DEC) FALSE
        * (The first digit is discarded due to the lost memory)

1. Sufficient Memory and `inproper carry bit` (show sign)
    * -17 = 1-01111
    * -19 = 1-01101
    * 
        *   1-01111
        *  +1-01101
        * =10-11100
        * = 0-11100 = 28(DEC) FALSE
        * (The first digit is discarded due to the algerithem/mem)
        * (Similarly, 0-11111 + 0-00001 will be 1-00000 which is false)

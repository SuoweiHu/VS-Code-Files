## Unix Brief

What is unix?: (basic)

* Unix is one of the "multi-tasking", "multi-user", "multi-thread" computer operating system.
* was developed by Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson (FKn Genius) starting on 1970s and belongs to the AT&T company
* was a little bit under-powered though

What gives UNIX the popularity?
* 1972, unix was re-written in C landuage (by ken Tompson in majority)
    * C was a lower programming landuage
    * at the time, the sybolic landuage was more polupar (but requires you to rewrite the whole system for adj)
* By the computer scientist, for the computer scientiest
* A&T (1975) was banned to sell computer system (so they are forced to give out the system for free), and that is also when the edu/ gov get in touch the system for a main-frame computer
* A good new operating system for the mainframe computer (using one core computer + many keyboard and monitor)

> Open source(Linux), close source(orcle), mixed source(Apple's Mac os)\
(Max OS = BSD Unix + NexTSTEP + Apple Codeing)

Characteristics:

* Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the "Unix philosophy". 
    * Quote: "A programmer can write a few line of code, that trun into many many instructions in the machine. That way, when the changes needs to be make, we'll just change a few lines of code, rather than thousands and thousands of them."
* The unix is made of three lays:
    * Center layer: The `KENAL` is what controlls the resources of the machine, usually the kernal is standrized on every machine
    * Medium layer: The `SHELL` is the interface between the kernal and the most users
    * Outter layder: The `UTILITIES` (user programs) 
        * e.g adding compiler for the landuage, document formatting landuages/ programs... or programs that u write yourself
* What differs unix with other operating system is the concept of `MODULE`
    * The unix has a very important comcept of module
    * unlike most of the OS, modules in unix can be glued together in variety of ways to get the job done
    * variety of combining the modules and changing the flow of the data
* not very unique, but unix has the idea of hierarchy
* since the flow of the input is controlled by the shell, the input/ouput of a specific program (Outter layer) can be redirected unlike other operating system

Why using the UNIX instead of the graphical interface (GUI)?
* there a lot more power in command line 
    * e.g finding a file including "invoice"
        * UNIx will only have the text file name so small data group
        * GUI might include the time/ content of the file which slows the program down

> What other operating system, example of the comparison????? \
> Command prompt vs a shell (unix interface connecting the kernal and the user program) ??\
> What is open source??? why is it important for user
> unix dirived systems ???? what are the braches extends from unix\

## what is floating point

* 0.000000015 in scientific notation is 1.5 * 10^-8
    * '1.5' is expressing the `mangnitude` of this floating point number, called `Mantissa`
    * '10^-8' is showing the point is floaing down for 8 places, called `Exponent`, the number we use to float for a negative direction. 
> BIT <=> **BI**nary digi**T**\
> BYTE <=> **B**inar**Y** **TE**am

* Now in binary: 
* (e.g an 8-bit binary memory)
    1. 4 bits mantissa
    2. 4 bits exponent
* 0110 0010
    1. 0010: Exponent 
        * |2^(-8)|2^4|2^2|2^1|
            |-|-|-|-|
            |0|0|1|0| 
        * Exponent: 10^(0010) => 2^(2)
        * `For why (-8) see the signed binary code below`
    1. 0110: Mantissa
        * |-1|1/2|1/4|1/8|
          |-|-|-|-|
          |0|1|1|0|
        * Mantissa before floating: 0.110 => 3/4 (2^(2))
        * Mantissa after  floating: 011.0 => 3

> Denary Number <=> Decimal, base-10

## Hihglight (= bullshit)
* python is one the the compiler landuage that includes the indentation into the as one of its logical line, used to determine the grouping of the statements 

```python
def print_grade(grade)
    if (grade > = 80): 
        print("HD")
    if (xxxxxx >= 70):
        print("D")
    etc.....
 ```

 this function will print the "HD,D,...." in downward sequence considering it is not using the else if statment, to solve it, you can either do 

 ```
 return (0)
 ```

 which will terminate the function after fitting the certain critiria, or you can

 ```
 if .... elseif....
 ```

 which will ongly go into the following "elseif" statment given the previous statment being false, or 

 ```
 if int_a<x<int_b if ....
 ```

 which limits the range of the score ranging fixing the error form the very beginning of the logical flow

## Recursive in python 

* Recursive means calling the function itself within the function 

* `definition of recuring: Recuring is a way of programmign or coding problem. In which a function calls itself one or more times within its body. Usually it is returning the return value of this function call.`

* `Generally we can say: Recursion in computer science is a method where the solution to a problem is based on solving smaller instances of the same problem. `

* a recursive function terminiates when all the recursive call of the function

### Exmaple of the recuring function
 ```python {cmd}
def function_name_ (base_num, count):
    a=count
    x=base_num
    if(False):

    else:
        a += 1
        print("current recuring for the {} time ----- {}".format(a, x))
        return function_name_(x-1,a)
   
```
here the function will run endlessly until the n reaches the minimum number (due to the float digit limit) and program crashes, giving the following error messgae 

```

  File "C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\lib\threading.py", line 1091, in is_alive
    self._wait_for_tstate_lock(False)

  File "C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\lib\threading.py", line 1048, in _wait_for_tstate_lock
    elif lock.acquire(block, timeout):

    RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
```

Example of the **base case**
```python{cmd}
def function_name_ (base_num, count):
    a=count
    x=base_num
    if x<0:
        print()
        return "the recursion has ended"
    else:
        a += 1
        print("current recuring for the {} time ----- {}".format(a, x))
        return function_name_(x-1,a)
    
```
here the funciont hase a *base case* to *terminate* the program, that is to finish the flow, the x will be [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], and when it became 0, it triggers the 1st if statment, ending the recursion using the base case.

```
    function_name_(10,0)
    current recuring for the 1 time ----- 10
    current recuring for the 2 time ----- 9
    current recuring for the 3 time ----- 8
    current recuring for the 4 time ----- 7
    current recuring for the 5 time ----- 6
    current recuring for the 6 time ----- 5
    current recuring for the 7 time ----- 4
    current recuring for the 8 time ----- 3
    current recuring for the 9 time ----- 2
    current recuring for the 10 time ----- 1
    current recuring for the 11 time ----- 0

    Out[75]: 'the recursion has ended'
```

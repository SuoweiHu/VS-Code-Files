* python is one the the compiler landuage that includes the indentation into the as one of its logical line, used to determine the grouping of the statements 

```python
def print_grade(grade)
    if (grade > = 80): 
        print("HD")
    if (xxxxxx >= 70):
        print("D")
    etc.....
 ```

 this function will print the "HD,D,...." in downward sequence considering it is not using the else if statment, to solve it, you can either do 

 ```
 return (0)
 ```

 which will terminate the function after fitting the certain critiria, or you can

 ```
 if .... elseif....
 ```

 which will ongly go into the following "elseif" statment given the previous statment being false, or 

 ```
 if int_a<x<int_b if ....
 ```

 which limits the range of the score ranging fixing the error form the very beginning of the logical flow

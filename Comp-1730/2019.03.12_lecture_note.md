## Hihglight
* python is one the the compiler landuage that includes the indentation into the as one of its logical line, used to determine the grouping of the statements 

```python
def print_grade(grade)
    if (grade > = 80): 
        print("HD")
    if (xxxxxx >= 70):
        print("D")
    etc.....
 ```

 this function will print the "HD,D,...." in downward sequence considering it is not using the else if statment, to solve it, you can either do 

 ```
 return (0)
 ```

 which will terminate the function after fitting the certain critiria, or you can

 ```
 if .... elseif....
 ```

 which will ongly go into the following "elseif" statment given the previous statment being false, or 

 ```
 if int_a<x<int_b if ....
 ```

 which limits the range of the score ranging fixing the error form the very beginning of the logical flow  

## Recursive in python


* recursive function means calling the function itself within the function

* `definition of recuring: Recuring is a way of programmign or coding problem. In which a function calls itself one or more times within its body. Usually it is returning the return value of this function call.`

* `Generally we can say: Recursion in computer science is a method where the solution to a problem is based on solving smaller instances of the same problem. `

* a recursive function terminiates when all the recursive call of the function

> recursive funtion ??? further to be inves !!!!!!

> What does it mean by "it is returning the return value of this function call."

> What is "base case" in this case [A bse case is a case where the problem can be solved without further recursion ??????]

 ```python
 def function_name ()
    if this_statment:
        return (funciton_name())

    if 
    else:
        return
```

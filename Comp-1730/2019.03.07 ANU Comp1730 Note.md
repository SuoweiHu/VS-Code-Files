Spyder graph plotting example 


```
def m_cost (pple,rate,year):
    m_rate = rate/12
    r = m_rate /100
    n_pay = year * 12 
    return pple * (r * math.pow (1+r, n_pay))/(math.pow(1+r,n_pay)-1)

years = range (10,26)

mc = [m_cost (30000,5.0,y) for y in years] 
mpl.plot(years,mc,'g-')
mc = [m_cost (30000,6.0,y) for y in years] 
mpl.plot(years,mc,'b-')
mc = [m_cost (30000,7.0,y) for y in years] 
mpl.plot(years,mc,'r-')
mpl.show()

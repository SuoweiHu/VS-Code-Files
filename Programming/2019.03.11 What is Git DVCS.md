* helps tracking every single changes alone the way
    * that is most of the time, the programming team will run into problems such as knowing which changes come from which part of the programming flow, and merging multiple changes/ work flow into one 
    * version suffix you add such as "final" or "last" will and at most of the circumstansus, repeat with someone else's naming of the file, even yourselves'

## Bennifits of DVCS
* A complete long-term log of the history of every file
* Branching and merging
* Traceability

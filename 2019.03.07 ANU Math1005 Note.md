 Set 
* A set is a collection of elemtns 
* Not in any order (not needed to be)
* each element only appear `once`
---
Finite Set
* Singleton: only one element {x}
* Booleam: False and True {True,False}
* Range of numbers: {1,2,3,....,19}
---
Infinite Set
* Natural Number
* Intergers 
* Real numbers
* `Strings`: List of character of any finite length
> Why is string a infinite set????
---
Combining set
* Sum: A + B, the two set remain disjoint
    * e.g A = True,False B = True,False
    * A + B = {(True, form A), (True, fomr B)......}
* Product: A x B, the two set is forming a `new set`
---
Functions 
* f:: A -> B, A called domain, B called codomain
    * The function assign `every` input A in domain on to `some` of the B in codomain as ouput
    * f :: A -> B, can also be written as f(a)=b
---
Minus :: Z -> Z is defined as minus(x) = -x
isPod :: Z -> B is defined as isPod(x) = T (if pos); F (is neg)
* Here x and y are called variables, and are in set Z
---
Polymorphic Functions 
* A function that can be defined `simultaneously` for many different sets is called polymorphic.
    * identity funciton: 
        * id :: A -> A def as id(a) = a
    * constant zero function: 
        * constZero :: B-> Z def as constZero = 0
> What about containning more than one set, such as two set (not containning all the set known), such as the previous minus function, applies for Z and R, but not for B, is it polymorphic
---
Other example of the polymorphic functions:
* Left/ Right Injection:
    * injR :: A -> A + B def as injR(a) = (b,a) 
    * injL :: A -> A + B def as injL(a) = (a,b)
    * injection means appening/adding the element 
* Left/ Right Projection:
    * proR :: A + B -> A def as proR(a,b) = (a) 
    * proL :: A + B -> A def as proL(a,b) = (b) 
---
Combining functions: Composition
* g * f(a) = g(f(a))
---
Combining sets: Set of functions 
* by given domain and codomain as A and B
* A->B menas the set of `all possible functions from A to B`
* f::A -> B means f is one of the element of set A -> B (all the possible function of going from set A to set B)
> what does it mean by f::A->B then \
> Does it mean that the ooooo question solved by PPT XD
---
Combining sets - sets of functions
* Right associativity: 
    * `A -> B -> C = A -> (B -> C)`
    > then does the above set means: all the functions of going from set A to (function of going from set B to set C)?????
* E.g: given:
    * f :: A -> B -> C
    * a,b,c are elements of A,B,C individually
    * f(a) is the function of (B -> C)
    * so there is A -> (B -> C) is def by a=f(a)
    * f(a) x b is an element of set C
---
Combining sets - set of functions
* Polymorphic example:
    * *pair :: A -> B -> A x B* is def by *(pair(a))(b) = (a,b)*
    * *cmopose :: (B -> C) -> (A -> B) -> A -> C* is def by *(compose(g))(f)(a) = g(f(a))*
        * That is g :: B-> C, and f :: A -> B, and a :: A
    > How to explain `pair` and `compose` with the Right Assiciativity properties when combining set ????? A -> (B -> AxB) ???????
    >
    > Quiz: can you define a sensible polymorphic function from the set
    >A + B ⟶ (A ⟶ B) ⟶ (A ⟶ C) ⟶ C?

Interpreter vs Compiler
* Compiler 
    * `translate` the source landuage (higher-level landuage) into object landuage (machine language)  
    * `faster` (sine machine landuage) / but `more` memory
    * generate inter-mediate program during compile
    * `HARD` to debug (display all the error at onece, might relate to cross reference etc)
    *  ~~compiler is a program that reads a program written in the high-level language and converts it into the machine or low-level language and reports the errors present in the program. It converts the entire source code in one go or could take multiple passes to do so, but at last, the user gets the compiled code which is ready to execute.~~
    
    > Phase Of compiler ??????????
    >
    > ~~Compiler operates in various phases each phase transforms the source program from one representation to another. Every phase takes inputs from its previous stage and feeds its output to the next phase of the compiler. There are 6 phases in a compiler~~

* Interpreter 
    * `stimulate` the source landuage (Such as custom lib)
    * take the whol praogram and translate
    * take a line of code 
    * `slower` / but `less` memory
    * not produce inter-medium code
    * `EASY` to debug (display error on each line)
    * ~~Employing an interpreter is advantageous during program development, where the most important part is to be able to test a program modification rapidly rather than run the program efficiently.~~

* COMPILER LANDUAGE:
    * C
    * C#
    * C++
    * Scala

* INTERPRETER LANDUAGE: 
    * PHP
    * Peral
    * Ruby
> So..... WTF is a compiler landuage and what is a interpreter landuage

Programming paradigms: 

* Control flow: imperative/declarative
* Declarative: functional/logic/finite state machines
* Allocations and bindings: static/dynamic
* Time: event-driven/discrete/synchronous/continuous
* Focus: control flow/data flow
* Concurrency: sequential/concurrent/distributed
* Structure: modular/generics/templates/objects/aspects/agents
* Determinism: deterministic/non-deterministic
* You don’t need to understand all of these; just many ways to program

> Further research on this topic please 

> What is the imperative/declarative ?????? imperative = programmer telling the computer the state/ number etc ?????? declartive = tell computer what to do with the data 

> Is it the Imperative tells program HOW TO DO ????\
> And Declarative tells the program WHAT SHOULD BE THE OUTPUT ????

>![Impreative vs Dec;arative](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mt7KnvnNGfk/maxresdefault.jpg)

> Calling the function is declarative?????
---
Phase Of Compilation:
1. Lexical analysis
    * checking wether there is lexies that is not part of the current compiling environment (word block that computer can take as an input) 
2. Syntax analysis
    * Checking wether the operation is permitted by the current programmign landuage 
    * Such as missing parathesis

3. Semantic analysis
    * Checking weather there are type errors 
    * e.g1
        * void fucntion_name(int,string); 
        * then if you try to use void (char,float)
        * a semantic error will pop up
    * e.g2
        * int x = 20/3 (giving float)

4. Intermediate code generator
    * the operation can be divided into parts
    * e.g 
        * total = count + rate * 5 (Source Code)
        * 
        * t1 := int_to_float(5) 
        * t2 := rate * t1 
        * t3 := count + t2
        * total := t3           (Intermediate Code)


5. Code optimizer
    * removing the un-necessary code: annotations, loop that the program will not go into, un-necessary type changing, etc
    * e.g
        * intofloat(2.00) => 2.00
        * void function_name () {if(FALSE){}} => NULL
        * #123 => NULL

6. Code generator
    * a = b + 60.0 => Code below 
    * 
    * MOVF a, R1
    * MULF #60.0, R2
    * ADDF R1, R2

OUTLINE:\
Lexical analyzer: Wrongly spelled tokens\
Syntax analyzer: Missing parenthesis\
Intermediate code generator: Mismatched operands for an operator\
Code Optimizer: When the statement is not reachable\
Code Generator: Unreachable statements\
Symbol tables: Error of multiple declared identifiers

Python Error Sum: [List of python error message](https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/people/mccann/errors-python)

* ModuleNotFoundError: 
* ImportError:
* StopIteration:
* typeError: 
    * the type of the program does not follow the semantic grammar
* ValueError:
    * when the function has invalid/ inappropriate argument
* NameError:
    * when the object cannnot be found (such as forgetting the pre-def)
* ZeroDivisionError
* KeyboardInterrupt

`Disjunctive normal form`
* For output equals to 1 express with AND, and join the result with OR, the result is said to be disjunctive normal form
* e.g Design a circuit (X,Y,Z) = (1,1,1) & (1,0,0)  
---
`Predicate`
* sentence containning one or more than one var, with the property that when a value is given to the var, it became a statment
* e.g 
    * P(x) = x is a cat; (Who is peter) 
    * Q(X) = X has the full controll of the system; (Is x the admin, or just generic user)
* demain will vary depending on the set of value that var can take
* Two ways to turn a predicate into a statment:
    1. specify the value of variable (x)
    2. quantify the value of the variable (x)
        * Quantify = express quantity
        * Universal Quantifier:  A upside down (For all) ------> universal statment
        * Existential Quantifier: E mirror image (For some) -----> exismential statment
        * e.g 
            * Domain: {1,3.0000,2,"hello",'r',1999999}
            * p(x) = "x is a integer" 
            * For some x ........ will be a existential statment 
---
`∃!p(x)` means there exist only one (unique) x such that the statment p(x) is true
